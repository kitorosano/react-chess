# Chess Game - React + TypeScript

This is a simple chess game built using React and TypeScript. The game allows two players to play chess against each other on a virtual chessboard. The project includes all standard chess pieces, a chessboard, and basic game logic.

## Features

- Play chess with another player (local multiplayer)
- Display chessboard with pieces in their starting positions
- Move pieces according to standard chess rules
- Highlight legal moves for pieces
- Game-over detection (checkmate)

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing state.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the game interface.

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chess-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd chess-game
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app should now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

- The chessboard will load with the pieces in their initial positions.
- Click on a piece and then click on a valid destination square to move it.
- The game will detect if the move is legal or if there is a check or checkmate situation.

Enjoy playing the game!
